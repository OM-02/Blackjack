# Blackjack Game
This is a simple blackjack game created for a school project.

Currently, it cannot keep track of suits and cannot keep track of number of cards played, it can only give you a random card value and keep track of it. It is currently possible to play a game with 10 aces. Aces are assumed to be 11 and automatically changed to a 1 if a hit takes you over 21.

Planned Features:
- Computer players
- Suit tracking
- Adding a real deck system
